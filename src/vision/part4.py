def my_conv2d_freq(image: np.ndarray, filter: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Apply the Convolution Theorem to perform the convolution operation. 
    
    Return 
    - the input image represented in the frequency domain, 
    - the filter represented in the frequency domain,
    - the result of the convolution in the frequency domain, and 
    - the result of the convolution in the spatial domain.

    We will plot and analyze these to gain a better understanding of what is going on.

    Args:
        image: array of shape (m, n)
        filter: array of shape (k, j)
    Returns:
        image_freq: array of shape (m, n)
        filter_freq: array of shape (m, n)
        conv_result_freq: array of shape (m, n)
        conv_result: array of shape (m, n)
    HINTS:
    - Pad your filter in the spatial domain. We want to retain all of the high frequencies after the FFT
    - Return only the real component of the convolution result
    - Numpy considers frequency graphs differently than we have shown them in class. Look into the 
      documentation for np.fft.fft2 for how to account for this in the output image.
    - When applying padding, only use the zero-padding method.
